You're working on a PHP-based full-stack leave management system named "UPLeave." The project includes core functionalities like:

- Employee login (session + OTP)
- Leave application submission
- Role-based approval workflow (Employee, HOD, Dean, Principal)
- Smart Leave Reason Enhancer using DeepSeek API
- Leave history stored in MySQL
- Chart.js visualizations for analytics

Your task: Help me implement a **PHPUnit-based testing layer** for this project.

1. First, identify and list **5 key backend PHP functions or components** that are suitable for unit testing (e.g., leave date validation, leave quota check, etc.).

2. For each identified component, **write a PHPUnit test case** (assuming the functions are modular or in separate files).

3. Provide **step-by-step instructions** to set up PHPUnit using Composer, compatible with a local XAMPP/LAMP environment.

4. Show how to **structure a `tests/` folder** inside the project with sample test files.

5. Suggest how I can add a test summary to the README, and how to display test status with a badge if hosted on GitHub.

Assume I am a beginner to testing in PHP, so explain clearly and practically. The project is in plain PHP (no Laravel or Symfony).
