1. Program to create a new file.
filesample = "new_file.txt"
with open(filesample, 'w') as file:
    file.write("This is a new file!")
print("New file has been created.")
New file has been created.

2. Program to write data to file. 

newfile = "data_file.txt"
with open(newfile, 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, hii!!!.")

3. Append contents to file.

f1 = "data_file.txt"
with open(f1, 'a') as file:
    file.write("Appending data to the file.")

4. Read content of the file using readline()

file1 = "data_file.txt"
with open(file1, 'r') as file:
    line = file.readline()
    while line:
        print(line.strip())  
        line = file.readline()

5. Python program to read first N characters from each line.

file1 = "data_file.txt"
n = 10
with open(file1, 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        first_n_characters = line[:n]
        print(first_n_characters)

6. Python program to read character by character from a file.

file1 = "data_file.txt"
with open(file1, 'r') as file:
    char = file.read(1)
    while char:
        print(char, end='')  
        char = file.read(1)

7. Program to delete a file.

import os
file1 = "file_to_delete.txt"
if os.path.exists(file1):
    os.remove(file1)
    print("The file has been deleted.")
else:
    print("The file does not exist.")

The file has been deleted.

8. Append content of one text file to another

sourcef = "source_file.txt"
dest = "destination_file.txt"
with open(sourcef, 'r') as source:
    content_to_append = source.read()
    with open(dest, 'a') as destination:
        destination.write(content_to_append)

9. Count number of lines in a text file

file1 = "example.txt"
with open(file1, 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
number_of_lines = len(lines)
